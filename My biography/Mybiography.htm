	<h1>Philippaâ€™s Biography</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p1>My name is Philippa and I am 16 years old. I was born on the 19th of August 2005 in England. I am currently a student at Pymble Ladies College where I study
		English, maths, biology, chemistry, economics and software. Prior to Pymble I lived in England for three years, Australia for six years, and then Singapore for four years
		where I went to the Australian International School. Afterwards I boarded at Pymble for 2 years whilst my parents
		and little brother Oliver lived in New York before moving back in 2019.</p1>

	<h3>What I like</h3>

	<p2>My favourite hobby/sport at the moment is basketball. Currently I play in three competitions, Pymble, Hornsby
		spiders and Norths, two of which are non-competitive and just for experience out of basketball season. I also
		enjoy spending time with my cat gizmo who is much cuter than siennas dog, and eating unhealthy food like
		chocolate.</p2>

	<h3>Interview</h3>

	<p>An interview was conducted with Nilan Esmaeili, another year 11 student at Pymble to help learn what others
		think of me.</p>

	<p>	"Philippa is a hard worker and is always determined to achieve her goals. She perceives herself through her studies and sport, always keeping on top of her homework, whilst having a balanced lifestyle. Overall, she can be considerate and as an individual is a diligent person."</p>
